	4. 'V' --> Vigenere's Cipher

and TESTFILE is the name of the testfile for encrpyption/decryption.

Extra Functions:

	1. generateKey(long int size) / Generates a random key of size = size
	 using /dev/urandom for use in OTP encryption/decryption.
	
	2. removeIllegal(uint8_t *plaintext) / Removes illegal chars 
	(anything other than a-zA-z0-9) from plaintext. 

	3. generateVigKey(uint8_t *keyword, long int size) / Generates keyword for
	Vigenere's Cipher.

Changes to Functions:

	1. caesar_encrypt / Added int flag for printing purposes.
